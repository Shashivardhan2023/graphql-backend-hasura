- GraphQL is an API query language and run-time
- Hasura is a backend server for parsing and automating these queries.

### Fields:
- Sorting with `order_by`: choose columns by which to sort and additionally ascending, descending and nulls_first or nulls_last
  - use `distinct_on` to avoid querying duplicate entries
- Filtering and full-text search with `where`: choose columns and values to filter using conditional operations
- Combining filters with `_and`, `_not` and `_or`
- Pagination with `limit` and `offset`

### Operations:
- Mutations used to create, update and delete items
- Queries used to fetch data
- Subscriptions used to fetch data in realtime

### Event Triggers:
- Functions to be called when an operation is executed
- Makes call to specified endpoint when specified table is mutated

### Actions:
- Actions are triggers to call REST endpoints whenever an operation is executed
- These are used to interact with services which do not support GraphQL
- Declare a REST endpoint as Handler to be called when action is triggered

### Remote Schema:
- Remote Schemas are used when Hasura needs to interact with other GraphQL services

### Authentication:
- Tokens are sent in Request Headers to authenticate
- These tokens can be generated by 3rd parties
- Actions can be used to make Firebase generate the token for us
- Add user roles and permit roles to do specific operations conditionally
- Actions have permission settings to allow specific users to trigger them
